Hi there ğŸ‘‹
<!-- **CodeElectro/CodeElectro** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. Here are some ideas to get you started:
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a new machine learning project focused on natural language processing. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about deep learning and neural networks. 
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source data science projects.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with optimizing neural network architectures.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, machine learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT)
